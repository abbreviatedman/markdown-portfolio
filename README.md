# Markdown Portfolio

### Introduction

One of the major things we'll be working towards this term (and during your whole time here) is having a great portfolio page for you. The first step to this is content--what should go in our portfolio? We'll start figuring that out today, as well as continuing to practice our markdown-git-terminal triumvirate of tools.


### Setup

* We'll be making our portfolio in one page, in Markdown. You'll be creating a GitHub repo from scratch and cloning it down, with the following steps:
  1. Press "New" or "New Repository" on GitHub's page.
  2. Name it something... good?
  3. **DO** check the box "Initialize this repository with a README."
  4. Copy the URL from the new repo's page.
  5. In `week-0` on your local machine, perform a `git clone [repo url]` command.
  6. Edit the file `README.md`.
  7. `add`, `commit`, and `push` as you go!


### Requirements

* `commit`, `commit`, `commit`! You need a MINIMUM of 5 commits, but you ought to have more discrete accomplishments during this project than that. Practice thinking in terms of what you're about to do, and, when you've done that, `commit` with a message that you did it.
* We'll cover the content momentarily, but your markdown file needs to have the following:
  1. At least one link. This could be to your GitHub user page, to your LinkedIn, to your Twitter account, or some other resource that represents you to the world.
  2. At least one picture. Make sure it's [SFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work), but otherwise, anything goes!
  3. At least one bullet point list.
  4. At least one numbered list.


### Content

You want to be building towards a portfolio here, but because this is a process, please do not get paralyzed by indecision. We'll be editing this as we go throughout this term!

What a portfolio actually is depends on the person. Has design been your main focus? A gallery would be perfect here. Do you have a background either in code or somewhere that might lead to a code-related job, like sales, or teaching, or management? You might want to highlight that experience with a more resume-like portfolio. Do you have some projects, code or code-related, that you've worked on? A selection of projects (with links!) might be a good choice.

You can do any combination of this, of course!


### Goals

* Have _at least_ one full page of content.
* Use markdown wherever possible.
* Get some practice with managing your git repository.
